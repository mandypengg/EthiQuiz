# Ethics Quiz

The Ethics Quiz is a Java-based desktop application designed to test users’ ethical reasoning through interactive, scenario-based questions. Built using Java and Java Swing in Apache NetBeans, the application emphasizes feedback-driven learning, score persistence, and user-specific performance tracking.

## Features

- **User Identification & Score Tracking**  
  Users can enter their name to retrieve previously saved high scores. The application stores and associates quiz results with individual users, allowing returning users to track past performance.

- **Interactive Quiz Flow**  
  Users answer ethics-based questions through a graphical interface. Each response is evaluated immediately upon submission.

- **Answer Feedback & Explanations**  
  After each question, the application indicates whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect and displays a detailed explanation to reinforce ethical reasoning.

- **Retry & Session Reset**  
  Users can restart the quiz at any time, returning to the start screen to try again while preserving stored score data.

- **User-Friendly GUI**  
  Built with Java Swing, the interface supports smooth navigation between screens and clear presentation of questions, feedback, and results.
